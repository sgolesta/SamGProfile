## UBC Tutoring

A school project application for applying our knowledge of the database course material<br>
by simulating the management of a tutoring system.          

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Maven
* MySQL
* Spring Boot
* Vaadin

### How to Run

Put your own MySQL log-in details in /resources/application.properties.<br> 
Build the source code with Maven first and then run (the project jar), as in the tutorial.<br>
Alternatively, you can just use IntelliJ.<br>

### Acknowledgement
 
Our application is based on this tutorial in its architecture:<br>

Also, in the SQL script file for database creation, the idea for easily handling foreign<br>
key constraints when reloading the script is due to the following:<br>
